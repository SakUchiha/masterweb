## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- Groq API key (for AI Assistant functionality) - Get free access to Groq models
- A modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd code-understanding-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend/server.js
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. **Open the frontend**
   - Open `frontend/index.html` in your web browser
   - Or navigate to `http://localhost:4000` (if serving from server)

### Quick Start (Windows)

1. Double-click `start-app.bat` to automatically install dependencies and start the server
2. Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser

## Groq AI Setup

The AI Assistant uses Groq AI models directly for cost-effective, high-quality responses.

### 1. Get Groq API Key

1. Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Go to "API Keys" section in your dashboard
4. Create a new API key (it's free!)
5. Copy the API key

### 2. Configure the Backend

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/server.js/` directory:

```bash
cd backend/server.js
touch .env
```

Add your API key to the `.env` file:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_groq_api_key_here` with your actual Groq API key.

### 3. Verify Configuration

Restart the server and check that the AI assistant works:

```bash
# Restart the server
node server.js

# Check AI status in the browser
# Navigate to AI Assistant page and check the status indicator
```

### 4. Troubleshooting Groq Setup

**If API key is not configured:**
- Make sure the `.env` file exists in `backend/server.js/`
- Verify the API key format (should start with `gsk_`)
- Restart the server after adding the key

**If API calls fail:**
- Check your Groq account has credits (free tier available)
- Verify your API key is valid
- Check network connectivity
- Review Groq status page: https://status.groq.com

**If AI Assistant shows "unavailable":**
- Verify `.env` file exists with correct API key
- Restart the KidLearner backend server
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Ensure Groq API is accessible from your network
