## 🛑 Stopping the Application

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the application is running to stop both servers.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

- **Port conflicts**: If ports 3000 or 4000 are in use, modify the ports in the startup script
- **Python not found**: Install Python 3 to serve the frontend files
- **API errors**: Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
