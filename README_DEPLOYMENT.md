# 🚀 Quick Deployment Guide

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: GitHub Push Required

Your code is ready but GitHub is blocking the push because an API key was detected in commit history.

### ✅ Step 1: Allow GitHub Push

**You must click this link to allow the push:**

👉 **https://github.com/SakUchiha/masterweb/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/34rTWKv5zNjwpgi2NZnaSCscVfW**

1. Click the link above
2. Click "Allow secret" 
3. Return here and run: `git push origin main`

**Why?** GitHub protects your repository by scanning for secrets. Since we've removed all keys from current files, you can safely allow this one-time push.

### ✅ Step 2: Push Your Code

After allowing, run:
```bash
git push origin main
```

### ✅ Step 3: Setup Vercel

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Open your "masterweb" project
3. **Settings** → **Environment Variables** → **Add New**
4. Enter:
   - Name: `GROQ_API_KEY`
   - Value: (Get from `API_KEY_FOR_VERCEL.txt` in project root)
   - Environments: ✅ All (Production, Preview, Development)
5. **Save**

### ✅ Step 4: Redeploy

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **"..."** → **"Redeploy"**
3. Wait 2-5 minutes

### ✅ Step 5: Test

Visit: https://masterweb-rho.vercel.app/
- Home page: `/`
- Lessons: `/lessons.html`
- AI Assistant: `/ai.html`
- Health check: `/api/groq/health` (should show `{"status":"healthy"}`)

## 📋 What's Been Configured

✅ `vercel.json` - Routing and API configuration
✅ `api/groq.js` - Enhanced Groq API endpoint
✅ `api/lessons.js` - Lessons API endpoint
✅ `package.json` - Dependencies and build scripts
✅ All documentation files
✅ API key reference file (local only, not committed)

## 📝 API Key Location

Your API key is stored locally in: `API_KEY_FOR_VERCEL.txt`

**DO NOT** commit this file - it's already in `.gitignore`

## 🎯 Next Actions

1. **Click the GitHub link above** ← DO THIS FIRST
2. Run `git push origin main`
3. Add API key to Vercel
4. Redeploy
5. Test your site!
